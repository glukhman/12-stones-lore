The Empire of Elmanar is the largest country in the world of Rashpen, both in area and population. It is the main kingdom of humans in the continent of Erdahal, the largest of the four Blessed Realms, and as of 1337 [ER](https://www.notion.so/Major-events-in-world-history-38930a0dfb4e47458069aa3cf031aae2?pvs=21), it is the strongest military power in the history of the world. Home to 154 million people, it houses more than a quarter of the world’s total population (596 million as of 1325 ER).

The empire consists of 15 constituent states — 12 principalities, 1 grand duchy, and 2 provinces, in addition to the Imperial Capital Region (ICR) of Ristanna, and a number of conquered territories and colonies. Each of the principalities and the Grand Duchy of Northern Albredona are ruled by a hereditary royal house, but the emperor is elected for life by the princes, customarily by rotation between the states, similar to real-world Malaysia.

The current emperor, Anassar I, ascended the throne in 1303 ER following a coup d’etat, which led to a prolonged civil war in 1303-1312 ER. The other Blessed Realms — Eldacar, Zurbaghan and Monjarden — sent expeditionary forces to oppose the emperor, so as to keep the balance of power in Erdahal. As soon as the civil war was won, Anassar used his huge standing army to invade the three other realms, swiftly conquering them by 1320 ER and proceding forward to expand to the Southern Realms and the kingdoms of Saharac overseas. 

By 1335 ER, the empire controls a vart territory stretching over $^2/_3$ of mainland Erdahal, as well as about $^1/_5$ of the continent of Saharac, placing 60% of the world’s population under its tyrranical rule. Its enormous military is stretched thin across dozens of battlefields, trying to hold its grasp on the world amid numerous rebellions.

## Pre-imperial history

The history of the region which will eventually become the Empire begins in the late 14th century BER, when, under the auspices of the Sagrian Empire, the [Gharian](https://www.notion.so/Ethnic-groups-012fe9b8fb8540c3b4b6ab49366a365c?pvs=21) tribes began spreading to the lands of northern Erdahal, settling the valley of the Ermahand river and the northern shores of the Upper Sea. The early centuries of human settlement in Erdahal are shrouded in mystery and myth, with no written documents remaining from the era aside of sporadic runestones. Later poetry recounts the tales of heroes such as Antherion, the legendary first chieftain of the Beneghari, and of Yustver and Soumalay, twin heroes who defended the early human settlement from raids by the fearsome Kanadda tribes.

Soon, there were a dozen city-states to the north of the Upper Sea — such as Aspra (which is considered the “mother of Benegharian cities”, built around the 11th c. BER), Celmyr, Gonarbas and Lympor — which together constituted the *Commonwealth of the Beneghari*. 

In the later part on the 7th century BER, after the continued settlement of the [Naytir](https://www.notion.so/Ethnic-groups-012fe9b8fb8540c3b4b6ab49366a365c?pvs=21) along the west coast of northern Erdahal delivered a blow to the Sagrian sea trade, the gaze of the
magistrates in Old Sagria turned to the wealthy cities of the Beneghari, and a mighty host of the high kingdoms of Sagria Tramonte in the north and Sagria Ljante in the east, attacked the Benegharian settlements in what became known as the *Great Northern War*. Visgart of Aspra, Anagos (high chieftan) of the Beneghari by dint of ruling their greatest city, faced them with militias gathered from all 12 major cities of the Commonwealth; but they could not withstand the force which was thrown against them, and one by one their cities fell and were pillaged and torched. The chieftains of the Beneghari then allied themselves with the Saltirian Kingdom of Ragandon, which launched a surprise assault on the exposed Sagrian rear in the Erdahali provinces of Sagria Tramonte. But this also wasn’t enough, and in their agony the Beneghari turned to the gods for help. [The Keepers](https://www.notion.so/Deities-in-Rashp-n-635b0f1e028c4542842b08cf1d341172?pvs=21), who witnessed the sheer imbalance of power and saw the need to aid a human tribe on the brink of destruction, dispatched the goddesses of war, Viona and Mircalen, to aid the beleaguered Beneghari and Saltir against the Sagrian assault. The day was saved, and a fragile balance ensued, in which the Sagrians were deterred by knowing that now, two goddesses were on their enemies’ side. The Commonwealth of the Beneghari thus became an ascendant regional power.

### Anagói of the Commonwealth

| Name | Reign | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vísgart of Aspra   | 624-607 BER   |  |
| Eónach I   | 607–581 BER  |  |
| Sédhric   | 581–549 BER  |  |
| Calterén | 549– 523 BER  |  |
| Eónach II   | 523–498 BER |  |
| Niquefér   | 498–474 BER |  |

The Commonwealth has fought a prolonged war against their neighbors to the north in the ensuing century, avenging for the burning of their cities and striving to throw the Sagrians completely out of the Ermahánd valley. It was a just war. After all, they now had a goddess on their side, and all the cities of the Beneghari sent their best youth to the front lines. And in this crucible of fire and bronze and iron, a new nation was born — and in 485 BER, after wresting the city of Strátia, the capital of Sagria Ljánte, from the hands of the hated Sagrians, after 8 long years of siege, Niquefér of Áspra, Ánagos of the Commonwealth, entered the city and ousted Levénrjos III and put the crown of a High King upon his head.
The land was ravaged after long years of bloodshed, cities had to be rebuilt, crops replanted.
Niquefér engaged in a long process of reconstruction that would continue well into his son’s
reign. His son, Nicanór, moved his capital to Strátia and christened the newly formed
Benegharian nation as the *Strátian League*, a confederacy of all the cities of the Beneghari united under one banner and one ruler — its high king. The goddess Vióna fell in love with Nicanor and the two married. Their son, Anoralthár, was a hero of great might and renown, and expanded the territory of the League ever further into erstwhile Sagrian lands. He was a regular human by his looks, though of great stature but not as tall as the Saltír, and the arcane Arts they came to him naturally.

### High Kings of the Strátian League

| Name | Reign | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nicanór | 474-432  BER   | Moved the capital to Strátia. Assumed the title of High King after the Sagrian one lost all his vassal kingdoms |
| Anoralthár   | 432-395 BER  | Expanded the league’s territory westwards to the Naýholt-Pívenn line |
| Almíteras   | 395–368 BER  |  |
| Ardigalén | 368–337 BER   |  |
| Belén   | 337–321 BER |  |
| Belén II Ambréldas   | 321–300 BER   |  |
| Cáldwin the Great   | 300–276 BER   |  |

Cáldwin married Eliánna, daughter and only heir to the king of the river-state of Boúrj, thus gaining control over the greatest kingdom of the Cerneghári, he second of the three great human tribes to cross the Sea, and uniting under a single crown the Stratian League and the Zúrian League of the river kingdoms. Five generations apart from his demigod ancestor, he displayed talent for the Arts at a young age, and though they didn’t come naturally to him, he was able to study them as a sage under Sagrian tutelage, and became a leader glorious in might, to rival the legacy of Anoralthar. His sons divided his vast empire
among themselves — **Cállahan** the eldest inherited the Kingdom of Boúrj and leadership of the greater Nézarholn vale, which his great-grandson Antérion united into the *Kingdom of
Zurbaghán*; **Cáldrig**, the middle son, inherited the eastern part of the Stratian League and
established the Kingdom of Cáldria; and **Caltwár**, the youngest, established his own kingdom on the remaining lands to the west, with Áspra and later Dómmilen as its capital.

### Kings of Cáldria — the Stratian dynasty

   | 276–233 BER   | Viceroy from 296. Allied with his brother Caltwár to evict the remaining Sagrians from the peninsula   |
| Séndrig Neterión   | 233–199 BER   | Founded Felicitá. Began centralization   |
| Selsyár of Felicitá   | 199–162 BER    | Entered a coalition with Sagria Tramónte versus the encroaching empire of Ragandón   |
| Yánvir | 162–128 BER    |     |
| Gióssin   | 128–97 BER     |     |
